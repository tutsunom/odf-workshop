== Setup OpenShift Cluster
:profile: acs

To run OpenShift4, you need to have one provisioned environment using https://demo.redhat.com[RHPDS].
Go to Catalog -> Openshift 4.10 Workshop -> Order.

== Login OpenShift Web console

Once you have a workshop environment, you can also access OpenShift web console. +
The web console URL is shown in RHPDS as well as cluster admin username/password.

NOTE: If the language setting is NOT set to "English", it might to be good to set it "English" via User Preference menu.  +
If you continue this workshop without "English" setting, the pipeline will not display properly in the DevSecOps lab.

== Connect to your bastion server

You also need to access the bastion server in your environment via SSH.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
ssh lab-user@<YOUR_BASTION_SERVER>
----

Some CLI tools are already installed on you bastion server. You can check the OpenShift version using:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc version	
----

The output should show oc version >=4.10:	

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
Client Version: {ocp-version}
Server Version: {ocp-version}
Kubernetes Version: {kubernetes-version}
----

== Edit the default project template

Then first of all, the default Project Template must be edited. +
In the Openshift 4.10 Workshop environment provided by RHPDS, a Limit Range is automatically set for newly created projects. This can be an obstacle to the smooth running of the Workshop.

Use the `oc edit` command to clear the Limit Range section.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc edit template project-request -n openshift-config
----

Delete all of the following part from the `project-request` manifest and save it.

----
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: LimitRange
  metadata:
    name: ${PROJECT_NAME}-core-resource-limits
    namespace: ${PROJECT_NAME}
  spec:
    limits:
    - default:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 1.5Gi
      defaultRequest:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 256Mi
      max:
        cpu: 4
        memory: 6Gi
      type: Container
    - max:
        cpu: 4
        memory: 12Gi
      type: Pod
